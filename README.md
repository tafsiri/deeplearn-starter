# A starter project for using deeplearn.js

## Getting started

Clone this repository and install dependencies using either yarn or npm

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm install
```

Then run

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

The starter application should be running on `http://localhost:1234`.

## JavaScript or TypeScript

This project supports both JavaScript and TypeScript. The JavaScript code is included by default, but if you want to switch to typescript. Open up the index.html file and comment out the script tag that includes `index.js` and uncomment the script tag that includes `index.ts`.

## Dependencies

This starter project uses the parcel bundler to build the javascript that the browser consumes. Feel free to swap that out for whichever build system you are most comfortable with.
